# Progress

## What Works
1. Basic MCP server setup
2. Jira authentication
3. Basic ticket operations:
   - List tickets
   - Get ticket details
   - Get comments
   - Create tickets
   - Update status
   - Add comments
4. Project-specific text search:
   - JQL query builder
   - Project key validation
   - Text search escaping
   - Result formatting

## In Progress
1. Testing search functionality
   - Different project combinations
   - Error cases
   - Performance testing

## What's Left
1. Documentation
   - Update README with search examples
   - Document error cases
   - Add usage guidelines

2. Testing
   - Unit tests for search
   - Integration tests
   - Performance testing

3. Improvements
   - Result caching
   - Request logging
   - Error tracking

## Known Issues
1. None reported yet for the new search functionality
2. Areas to monitor:
   - Performance with large result sets
   - Memory usage with multiple concurrent searches
   - API rate limiting with frequent searches

## Project Evolution
1. Initial Setup (Complete)
   - Basic MCP server
   - Jira integration
   - Core ticket operations

2. Current Phase (In Progress)
   - Search functionality implemented
   - Testing and documentation
   - Performance optimization

3. Future Plans
   - Advanced search options
   - Result caching
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking integration

## Decision History
1. Chose to use native JQL for search
   - Better performance
   - Full Jira search capabilities
   - Native error handling

2. Command-based integration
   - More reliable
   - Better error handling
   - Easier debugging

3. TypeScript implementation
   - Type safety
   - Better maintainability
   - IDE support

4. Search Implementation
   - Project key validation
   - Text escaping for JQL
   - Result limiting for performance
   - Clear result formatting
